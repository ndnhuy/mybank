# Project Memory

## Last Updated
June 11, 2025 - Refactored load testing client to use modular Attacker class

## Project Overview
- **Name**: MyBank
- **Type**: Banking/Financial Service Application
- **Primary Language**: Java (Spring Boot) with Go load testing client
- **Framework**: Spring Boot, Maven, Docker
- **Architecture**: Microservice with database, containerized deployment

## Architecture & Structure
- **Main Service**: Java Spring Boot application (`src/main/java/com/ndnhuy/mybank/`)
- **Load Testing Client**: Go application (`clienttest/`)
- **Database**: SQL-based with initialization scripts (`deployment/init.sql`)
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose setup
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana integration
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API including `/accounts` endpoint for account management

### Key Components
- `AccountController.java`: REST API controller for account operations
- `BankService.java`: Core business logic for banking operations
- `AccountRepository.java`: Data access layer
- `Account.java`: Domain entity
- `clienttest/main.go`: Load testing tool for performance measurement

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **Java**: Standard Spring Boot conventions, builder pattern for entities
- **Go**: Clean, functional approach with environment-based configuration
- **Testing**: TDD approach mentioned in `TDD.md`
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types in Go client (`mybankerror/errors.go`)
- **Configuration**: Multiple application profiles (default, docker)

## Business Domain Knowledge
- **Core Entity**: Bank accounts with balance management
- **Operations**: Account creation, money transfers, balance inquiries
- **Transfer Logic**: Support for A->B, A->B->C, A->C+B->C transfer patterns
- **Concurrency**: Database-level locking for transaction consistency
- **Accuracy**: Critical requirement for financial operations

## Technical Insights
- **Performance Testing**: Mean response time measurement is primary KPI
- **Load Testing**: Uses Vegeta library for HTTP load generation
- **Concurrency Control**: Database-level locking implemented for data consistency
- **Scalability**: Investigation into how doubled load affects response time and accuracy
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive latency percentiles (50th, 95th, 99th) tracking

## Dependencies & Integrations
### Java (Maven)
- Spring Boot framework
- Database connectivity (likely JPA/Hibernate)
- Testing with JUnit

### Go Client
- `github.com/tsenart/vegeta/v12`: HTTP load testing library
- `github.com/stretchr/testify`: Testing framework
- Environment-based configuration

### Infrastructure
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for monitoring dashboards

## User Preferences
- **Code Quality**: Prefers clean, well-documented, modular code
- **Testing**: TDD approach with comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance**: Focus on mean response time measurement
- **Configuration**: Environment-variable based configuration for flexibility
- **Documentation**: Values clear explanations and usage examples
- **Output**: Prefers structured, readable output with clear metrics

## Common Issues & Solutions
### Load Testing Challenges (Resolved June 9, 2025)
- **Issue**: Original load test only showed 99th percentile, not mean response time
- **Solution**: Added prominent mean response time display in structured output
- **Issue**: Insufficient load (1 RPS, 5 seconds) for meaningful results
- **Solution**: Increased to 10 RPS, 30 seconds with configurable parameters
- **Issue**: Poor error handling and no success rate monitoring
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error detection and success rate validation
- **Issue**: Hard-coded parameters limiting testing flexibility
- **Solution**: Environment variable configuration (RPS, DURATION)

### Best Practices Established
- Load testing should use realistic request volumes (10+ RPS)
- Always monitor success rate alongside response times
- Provide configurable parameters for different testing scenarios
- Include comprehensive metrics (mean, median, percentiles)
- Add progress tracking for long-running tests

## Testing Strategies
- **TDD Approach**: Mentioned in project documentation
- **Accuracy Testing**: Verifying correct balance updates in transfers
- **Performance Testing**: Mean response time measurement under load
- **Load Impact Analysis**: How doubled load affects response time and accuracy
- **Scenario Testing**: Multiple transfer patterns (A->B, A->B->C, etc.)

## Recent Learnings
### Load Testing Improvements (June 9, 2025)
- Successfully refactored load testing tool for accurate mean response time measurement
- Implemented configurable load parameters via environment variables
- Added comprehensive error handling and success rate monitoring
- Created structured output format for better readability
- Established baseline testing parameters (10 RPS, 30 seconds)
- Added progress tracking and real-time error detection

### Technical Insights
- Vegeta library provides comprehensive latency metrics through `metrics.Latencies`
- Environment variable configuration pattern improves tool flexibility
- Progress indicators enhance user experience during long tests
- Success rate monitoring is crucial for accurate performance assessment

### Project Structure Understanding
- Clear separation between main service (Java) and testing tools (Go)
- Docker-based deployment with monitoring stack
- TDD methodology driving development approach
- Focus on financial accuracy and performance characteristics

### Code Refactoring (June 11, 2025)
- Successfully refactored load testing client to use modular Attacker class
- Extracted attack logic from main.go into reusable loadtest.Attacker class
- Maintained identical output and behavior while improving code organization
- Fixed import path issues and proper pointer handling for metrics
- Improved code modularity and reusability for future load testing scenarios

## Questions for Future Exploration
- What is the target mean response time for the `/accounts` endpoint?
- How does the service perform under higher loads (50+ RPS)?
- What are the database performance characteristics under concurrent load?
- How do different transfer patterns affect overall system performance?
- What monitoring alerts should be configured for production deployment?
